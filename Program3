-- 1. Create TEAM table first because other tables reference it
CREATE TABLE team (
    tid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    tname VARCHAR(20),
    coach VARCHAR(20),
    captain_pid INT,
    city VARCHAR(20)
);

-- 2. Create PLAYER table next since it references TEAM
CREATE TABLE player (
    pid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    pname VARCHAR(50),  -- Increased size for names
    age INT,
    tid INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (tid) REFERENCES team(tid)
);

-- 3. Create STADIUM table next since no dependencies exist
CREATE TABLE stadium (
    sid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sname VARCHAR(20),
    picode INT,  -- Changed NUMBER(8) to INT
    city VARCHAR(20),
    area VARCHAR(20)
);

-- 4. Create MATCH table next since it depends on TEAM, STADIUM, and PLAYER
CREATE TABLE match (
    mid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    mdate DATE,
    time TIME,  -- Changed VARCHAR(6) to TIME
    sid INT,
    team1_id INT,
    team2_id INT,
    winning_team_id INT,
    man_of_match INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (sid) REFERENCES stadium(sid),
    FOREIGN KEY (team1_id) REFERENCES team(tid),
    FOREIGN KEY (team2_id) REFERENCES team(tid),
    FOREIGN KEY (winning_team_id) REFERENCES team(tid),
    FOREIGN KEY (man_of_match) REFERENCES player(pid)
);

-- 5. Create PLAYER_PHONE table last since it references PLAYER
CREATE TABLE player_phone (
    pid INT,
    phone BIGINT,  -- Changed INT to BIGINT for phone numbers
    PRIMARY KEY (pid, phone),
    FOREIGN KEY (pid) REFERENCES player(pid)
);

-- Query 1: Find the youngest player and their team
SELECT pname, tname, age 
FROM player p, team t 
WHERE p.tid = t.tid 
AND age = (SELECT MIN(age) FROM player);

-- Query 2: Find the stadium where the most matches were played
SELECT * 
FROM stadium 
WHERE sid IN (
    SELECT sid 
    FROM match 
    GROUP BY sid 
    HAVING COUNT(sid) = (
        SELECT MAX(cnt) 
        FROM (SELECT COUNT(sid) AS cnt FROM match GROUP BY sid) AS temp
    )
);

-- Query 3: Find players who are not captains but have won "Man of the Match" twice
SELECT * 
FROM player 
WHERE pid NOT IN (SELECT captain_pid FROM team) 
AND pid IN (
    SELECT man_of_match 
    FROM match 
    GROUP BY man_of_match 
    HAVING COUNT(man_of_match) = 2
);

-- Query 4: Find the team with the most match wins
SELECT * 
FROM team 
WHERE tid IN (
    SELECT winning_team_id 
    FROM match 
    GROUP BY winning_team_id 
    HAVING COUNT(*) = (
        SELECT MAX(cnt) 
        FROM (SELECT COUNT(winning_team_id) AS cnt FROM match GROUP BY winning_team_id) AS temp
    )
);

-- Query 5: Find teams winning in multiple stadiums
SELECT tname 
FROM team 
WHERE tid IN (
    SELECT winning_team_id 
    FROM match 
    GROUP BY winning_team_id 
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT sid) > 1
);

-- Query 6: Retrieve matches played in a specific stadium
SELECT * 
FROM match 
WHERE sid = 1;

-- Query 7: Retrieve all teams participating in the "ABC CUP" tournament
SELECT * 
FROM team 
WHERE tid IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT team1_id FROM match 
    UNION 
    SELECT DISTINCT team2_id FROM match
);
