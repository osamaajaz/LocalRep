-- 1. Create TEAM table first because other tables reference it
CREATE TABLE team (
    tid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    tname VARCHAR(20),
    coach VARCHAR(20),
    captain_pid INT,
    city VARCHAR(20)
);

-- 2. Create PLAYER table next since it references TEAM
CREATE TABLE player (
    pid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    pname VARCHAR(50),  -- Increased size for names
    age INT,
    tid INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (tid) REFERENCES team(tid)
);

-- 3. Create STADIUM table next since no dependencies exist
CREATE TABLE stadium (
    sid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    sname VARCHAR(20),
    picode INT,  -- Changed NUMBER(8) to INT
    city VARCHAR(20),
    area VARCHAR(20)
);

-- 4. Create MATCH table next since it depends on TEAM, STADIUM, and PLAYER
CREATE TABLE match (
    mid INT PRIMARY KEY,
    mdate DATE,
    time TIME,  -- Changed VARCHAR(6) to TIME
    sid INT,
    team1_id INT,
    team2_id INT,
    winning_team_id INT,
    man_of_match INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (sid) REFERENCES stadium(sid),
    FOREIGN KEY (team1_id) REFERENCES team(tid),
    FOREIGN KEY (team2_id) REFERENCES team(tid),
    FOREIGN KEY (winning_team_id) REFERENCES team(tid),
    FOREIGN KEY (man_of_match) REFERENCES player(pid)
);

-- 5. Create PLAYER_PHONE table last since it references PLAYER
CREATE TABLE player_phone (
    pid INT,
    phone BIGINT,  -- Changed INT to BIGINT for phone numbers
    PRIMARY KEY (pid, phone),
    FOREIGN KEY (pid) REFERENCES player(pid)
);
